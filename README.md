## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned

I learn a lot of media query and  i know i'm not praticing the best way because it can be so much simplfy when i select that media query more generalize and in a laptop view i think this card is too small.

### Continued development

Maybe i wanna practicing better way refactoring my css cause it's terrible and do some research to make more simplfy, yeah thats all i wanna to do to continuing develop this project.
